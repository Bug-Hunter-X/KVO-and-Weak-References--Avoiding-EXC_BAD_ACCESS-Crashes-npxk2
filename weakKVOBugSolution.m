To solve this issue, ensure that the observer always removes itself from the KVO observation before it's deallocated.  This usually involves calling `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` in the observer's `-dealloc` method.  You can add a check to prevent removing the observer multiple times to handle unexpected situations.  Here is the corrected code:

```objectivec
@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) ObservedObject *observedObject;
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // Handle KVO notification
}

- (void)dealloc {
    if (self.observedObject) {
        [self.observedObject removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@
