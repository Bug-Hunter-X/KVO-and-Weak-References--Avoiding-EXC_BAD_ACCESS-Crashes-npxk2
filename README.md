# Objective-C KVO and Weak References Bug
This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and weak references.  The bug occurs when a weakly referenced observer is not removed before the observed object is deallocated, leading to crashes. The solution provides a safe and robust method for handling KVO with weak references.

**Bug:** The `weakKVOBug.m` file shows how a crash can occur when the observed object is deallocated before the observer is removed from observation. This typically manifests as an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.

**Solution:** The `weakKVOBugSolution.m` file demonstrates the correct way to manage KVO with weak references, preventing crashes and ensuring memory safety.  It emphasizes using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` within the observer's `dealloc` method or a suitable cleanup mechanism to ensure that the observer is unregistered before the observed object is deallocated.
